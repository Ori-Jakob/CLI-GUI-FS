# CLI-GUI-FS
A simple proof of concept for creating a CLI GUI that can traverse the file system.\
By default, the menu will open in the current working directory.\
Needs the `keyboard` library to be installed to correctly detect keyboard inputs.


# Controls

`UP_ARROW`: Move up through the menu\
`DOWN_ARROW`: Move down through the menu\
`RIGHT_ARROW/ENTER`: Enter a folder or open a file\
`LEFT_ARROW/BACKSPACE`: Travel up a directory (you can also use the three dots at the top) 
`ESC`: Exit the application
