# CLI-GUI-FS
A simple proof of concept for creating a CLI GUI that can traverse the file system.
By default, the menu will open in the current working directory.

# Controls

UP_ARROW: Move up through the menu
DOWN_ARROW: Move down through the menu
RIGHT_ARROW/ENTER: Enter a folder or open a file
LEFT_ARROW/BACKSPACE: Travel up a directory (you can also use the three dots at the top)
